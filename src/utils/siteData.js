    "Programming is my passion, and love to work and projects even in my free time. When I'm not writing code I'm working on my PC, or playing video games. My first job in the industry was working for Spectrum Cable, where I learned what was needed from a large company in an office setting. I am a self-taught developer with React however I have taken some Computer Programming college courses, and am working towards a Bachelor's Degree in the field. While this does present some challenges, I feel that it has helped me work through any problems I come across, and gives me a stronger base to work from. I do know that I am far from knowing everything, but I have learned some great tricks from researching my issues, and I'm sure they will lend to a great final product for any site I am working on.",
